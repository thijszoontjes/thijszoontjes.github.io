												<p> One of the best sporting technoligies out is a treadmill to determine which running shoes you need.  </p>
												<p> You will walk a couple of 100 meters and a screen will show how you place you foot in the shoes you have tested. </p>
												<p> Based on that you can choose new choes and will determine again if the shoes fit. </p>
													Eventually <em> you </em> will have some good data which shoes will fit the best. The data will be sent via email.

													<p>This one could be a little bit silly, but it is a good innovation. I am talking about the Computerized Scoring Bowling.</p>
													<p> A computer will focus on the score, while you can focus on the bowling aspect and don't have to count your scores. </p>
													<p>These small innovations have a impact about our daily life without you aven noticing.</p>
													<footer>
														<p>
														Fun Fact: The risk of a false score went down drasticly after this invention. </p>

														<p>And the last innovation i want to talk about are the invention of photo finishes.</p>
														<p>Since this invention there were no more questions about who won a race. </p>
														<p>The cameras will make 3000 frames per second, This way, nothing can go wrong. </p>
														<p>Most of the time the cameras are used for running games or horse racing. </p>
